    description: "I built this app because one of my passions is cooking. I love cooking for my family and big functions. I thoroughly enjoy trying new things and branching out my pallet, instead of having the same dish I go to. The intent of this app was to cater to people who generally make the same dishes at home or want to find a recipe with the ingredients they have at home but just donâ€™t know what to make with them.
